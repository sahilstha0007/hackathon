# Frame It - My Frame Your Art Our Platform

![Frame It Logo](./frontend/public/images/logo.png)

## Introduction 
Our team finest participated in this hackethon organized by tech titans for a purpose which is to solve the problems related to local artist marketplace
1. Limited Visibility
Challenge: Many local artists struggle to reach a global or even national audience due to limited marketing resources, platforms, or knowledge of digital marketing strategies.
Impact: Without exposure, their work often remains unknown, limiting their potential sales and growth.

2. Cultural and Societal Barriers
Challenge: Local artists may face societal biases, especially in regions where certain art forms are undervalued, or art is not seen as a viable career.
Impact: This can result in a lack of recognition and support from both the public and government.

3. Pricing Challenges
Challenge: Determining the right price for their art can be difficult, especially when competing with other artists or platforms that dictate pricing structures.
Impact: Artists may underprice their work out of a lack of confidence or overshoot with prices that aren't market-competitive, leading to lost sales.

4. Lack of Networking and Community Support
Challenge: Many local artists work in isolation without sufficient networks or community support.
Impact: This can limit opportunities for collaboration, exposure, and growth. Artists may miss out on valuable partnerships or learning opportunities.

5. Cluttered User Interface
Problem: Overcrowded screens with too many elements, buttons, or text can overwhelm users and make it difficult to navigate the interface.
Impact: Users may get frustrated, struggle to find what they're looking for, and ultimately abandon the platform or app.

##Problem-Solving
After brainstorming  we came up with these solutions like

1. User-Friendly Artist Profiles:
Create customizable artist profiles that allow them to showcase their art, live comment and like counts and personal story behind the artwork. The profiles should include a professional-looking photo and an "about me" section.

2. Artwork Listing with Detailed Information:
Enable artists to upload high-resolution images of their artwork, along with detailed descriptions. Each listing should feature essential information like pricing, availability details.

3. E-commerce Integration for Seamless Transactions:
Integrate a secure and user-friendly e-commerce system, allowing buyers to purchase artwork directly through the platform. Provide multiple payment options (credit cards, PayPal, etc.), and include an easy-to-use shopping cart and checkout process.

4. User Roles (Artist and Buyer):
Implement a role-based authorization system where users can register as either an artist or a buyer. Artists would have access to tools for uploading and managing their artwork, while buyers would have access to browse, purchase, and interact with art listings. This helps differentiate user experiences based on roles.

## Implementation 
1. Set Up User Roles (Artist and Buyer)
Since Frame It is an online marketplace for artists and buyers, you'll need to define two primary user roles:

Artist: Can upload, delete, and manage artwork.
Buyer: Can browse, purchase, and interact with artworks.
Steps:
During the user registration process, add a field that allows users to choose their role (Artist or User). You can also set default values (e.g., User) and let admins assign roles for users.
Store the role in the user database (MongoDB, for example). When a user logs in, retrieve their role and manage access based on it.

2. JWT Authentication for Secure Login
To implement secure login and session management, use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.

Steps:
On login, authenticate the user by verifying their credentials (email and password).
Once verified, generate a JWT token and send it to the frontend.
The frontend stores the JWT in localStorage or cookies to maintain user session.
For each subsequent request, the frontend includes the JWT in the Authorization header (Bearer token), and the backend verifies the token.

3. User-Centered Design (UCD) Principles
Simple Navigation: Ensure that users (artists and users) can easily navigate between sections (home, art gallery, contact, checkout, etc.) without feeling overwhelmed.
Mobile-First: Design with a mobile-first approach, as many users may access the platform from their phones. Then, optimize for tablets and desktops.
Accessibility: Make sure that the website is accessible to all users. This includes keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and color contrast.

4. Design Layout
Home Page (Landing Page)
  Hero Section:
  A clean, visually stunning hero section that highlights featured artwork. Use a large, high-quality image or an interactive 3D model (via Three.js or React-Three-Fiber) that represents the spirit of the     
   platform.

About Section Layout
  Large Background Image/Video: Use a high-quality image or video showing artists creating or displaying artwork. Alternatively, use an animated 3D model or gallery showcase.
  Text Overlay: Include the platform's tagline or mission statement over the image/video.

 Art Page Structure
The Art page should have the following sections:

  Title: Display the page title or an introductory heading like "Post Your Artwork."
  Upload Form: Provide fields for uploading the art.
  Image Upload: An image field where users can upload artwork images.
  Details Form: Additional form fields to fill out such as title, description, category, price, etc.
  Submit Button: Button to submit the artwork for posting.

SingleArt Page Structure
  The SingleArt Page should include:
  
  Artwork Display: Display the artwork with details like title, description, artist, and price.
  Like Button: A button to like the artwork.
  Comment Section: A section where users can leave comments.
  Form to Add Comment: A simple form with a text area for users to write their comment.
  Comment List: Display a list of previous comments for the artwork.

5. Checkout Page
The checkout process should be as simple and intuitive as possible. It should include:

Order Summary: List the selected artworks, quantity, total price, and shipping info.
Payment Integration: Use a popular payment gateway like Stripe or PayPal for secure payments.
Form Validation: Ensure all necessary information (shipping address, contact info) is filled out properly before submitting.

## Process of creation

Project Goals: Establish clear goals, such as providing a platform for local artists to showcase their work, secure transactions, and facilitate art sales.
Features List: Outline the essential features, such as artist profiles, artwork listings, shopping cart, secure payment system, comment/like system, etc.
Wireframes & Mockups: Design basic wireframes for the site, including the home page, artist profile, artwork listing page, and purchase flow.\

2. Frontend Development
Framework Selection: Use React.js for building the user interface, ensuring it is dynamic and responsive. Combine it with Tailwind CSS for styling.
Components Development:
Homepage: Design the homepage to showcase featured artworks, latest art, artist profiles, etc.
Artist Profile Page: Allow artists to upload and manage their artwork.
SingleArt Page: A detailed page showing individual artwork, including a like and comment system.
Checkout & Cart: Implement a shopping cart for users to buy artwork securely.
3D Features: Integrate Three.js or React-Three-Fiber to display 3D artwork for a more interactive user experience.
Routing: Implement the routing system using React Router to navigate between different pages (e.g., homepage, art gallery, login, checkout).

3. Backend Development
Server Framework: Use Express.js to create the backend REST API, handling data operations between the frontend and the database.
Database Setup: Set up MongoDB for storing user data, artwork details, comments, likes, and purchase orders. Create models for users, artworks, comments, and orders.
Authentication: Implement JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure user authentication, including features like login, registration, and password hashing with bcryptjs.
Artwork Management: Allow artists to upload, manage, and list artworks with detailed descriptions, prices, and availability.
Comment/Like System: Implement backend routes for adding comments and likes to artwork. Ensure that users can interact with artworks directly.

4. Integration
Frontend-Backend Communication: Use Axios for sending API requests from the frontend to the backend, such as fetching artwork, submitting comments, and handling user authentication.
Cloud Storage for Images: Use Cloudinary or similar services to handle artwork image storage and management.

5. Testing
Unit Testing: Write unit tests for individual components and functions using testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library.
Integration Testing: Test the integration between the frontend and backend to ensure smooth communication, such as verifying the comment posting functionality or the checkout process.
End-to-End (E2E) Testing: Use Cypress to perform automated end-to-end tests, ensuring the user journey from registration to checkout works seamlessly.
Security Testing: Conduct security tests to protect against common vulnerabilities like XSS, CSRF, and SQL injection.
